remove btn not on a specific space,
its pos changes when content-length changes

add routing for the notes to allow for bigger notes

add keyboard shortcuts
and also allow the user to define them and also remember them !

can see this for better split code 
https://gist.github.com/jpnelson/52d6f38820c6d028bdf8

also add theme switching 

i could add:
	pos: sticky on form
	or scroll on the content

try css grid instead of flex-box
grid-template-columns

IMPORTANT

i have to find a way to style this thing !!
add a better theme

required not working on form

useful links!

what is the difference between passing in a function vs object to setState ?
why should we pass functions as dependencies in useEffect https://youtu.be/j1ZRyw7OtZs?t=1013
why? =>
<button onClick={ () => setCount(c => c + 1) }>++</button>

initializer function for useState ?
https://youtu.be/j1ZRyw7OtZs?t=1130

kinda advanced: how does useState work under the hood ?
